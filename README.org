* My .emacs.d configuration
A clone of my Emacs configuration. It works as expected on most *nix
systems, including macOS. Uses =evil=.
Primarily for backup and redundancy purposes.

#+begin_quote
Unlike typical configurations: this one literally has
batteries included, when you clone the repository, you also clone
the packages required. This is to prevent dependency hell and TLS
key issues. As long as you're using Emacs 25+, you should be okay.

- =gccemacs= (native-comp branch) try.
