               WELCOME TO THE VHDL MODE OF EMACS !
              ------------------------------------

  I can see that you are green -  you are opening a  VHDL file for the
first time in Emacs. I hope that you will  get over your reluctance to
use Emacs, if you are used to vi. Don't worry, I will guide you along,
if need  be. All you have to  do at any time  you are stuck is type in
"help" and  then a space.  I will  ask you what  you want help on, and
tell you about that. There is  a manual for  this mode, and it will be
useful if you could have it around. 

  Next time on I  will suppress this welcome message  -- I will assume
that you have got some familiarity with the VHDL  mode. The only thing
you really have to remember is typing a space after "help".

  For your information,  this mode was  created by Vijay A. Nebhrajani
of the Hardware Group of Centre for Development of Advanced Computing,
Pune,  INDIA. Get  to him  at vijayn@parcom.ernet.in if  you  have any
suggestions or if you need any kind of help. Welcome again!
